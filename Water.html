        Water pollution is when a water supply is contaminated with harmful substances like chemicals or microorganisms. When water is polluted, the quality of the water decreases. This can lead to water becoming hazardous to plants, animals, the environment, and even humans.


In the United States, nearly 40% of rivers, lakes, and estuaries were deemed not clean enough for basic uses such as fishing and swimming. Additionally, there are an estimated 1.2 trillion gallons of stormwater, industrial waste, and untreated sewage that are dumped into US water each year.


But how does water get polluted, and what are the effects of water pollutants? In this article, weâ€™ll explain the causes of water pollution, as well as highlighting the effects of water pollution that make it so dangerous.


The Causes of Water Pollution


There are many different types of water pollution that are caused by a number of different things. Some of the main sources of water pollution include:

Sewage and Wastewater - Sewage and wastewater are types of water that have been used in some way already. This includes water from our toilets, showers, and sinks, as well as water from agricultural, commercial, and industrial activities. These can cause metals and other chemicals to enter our water systems, and even get into our drinking water. Stormwater runoff is part of this issue and occurs when rainfall washes chemicals, grease, salts, oil, and debris into waterways.
Oil Pollution - Oil and gasoline can enter our waterways through big oil tanker spills, but they also get washed into bodies of water after our vehicles drip them every day. Additionally, farms, factories, and cities produce large quantities of oil that can end up making its way into our water.
Agricultural - The agricultural industry is one of the biggest polluters of our waterways, as rainfall carries harmful animal waste, pesticides, and fertilizers into water systems. Due to the excessive amounts of some chemicals, this can lead to dangerous algal blooms and other issues.

The Effects of Water Pollution


With all of the different causes and types of water pollution, there can be some serious consequences for both humans and the environment. So, how does water pollution affect humans and the environment? Some of the main effects of water pollution include:

The Environment - The effects of water pollution on the environment as a whole can be catastrophic. The pollutants can be dangerous to both plants and animals, causing them to become ill and even die. Since water is a central part of life, it can have widespread effects when contaminated water enters the ecosystem, including entire populations of plants or animals dying off.
Human Health - Water pollution can also have severe consequences on human health, especially when contaminated water is consumed. Drinking water contaminated with metals or dangerous chemicals can lead to many different health issues, and even cause people to get sick and die. Even though there are purification systems in place, there are still many areas around the U.S. and the world with contaminated water.
